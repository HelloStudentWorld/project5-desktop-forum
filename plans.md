- [ ] Verify deployment

## Current Status
- Backend API is fully implemented and tested ✅
- Database connection is working with JAWSDB ✅
- Authentication system is working ✅
- API endpoints for users, posts, and comments are working ✅

## Next Steps
1. Create React frontend application
2. Set up Redux store and React Router
3. Implement frontend components
4. Connect frontend with backend API
5. Deploy the complete application to Heroku

## Testing Results
1. User Registration: ✅
   - Successfully created test user
   - Received JWT token
2. Post Creation: ✅
   - Created test post with authentication
   - Post saved with correct user association
3. Post Retrieval: ✅
   - Successfully retrieved posts with author information
   - Data structure is correct

## Notes
- Backend is using JAWSDB for both development and production
- JWT authentication is working correctly
- API endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- Error handling is implemented
- Database models and associations are working as expected
